# ytfzf

A posix script that helps you find Youtube videos (with out API) and opens/downloads using mpv/youtube-dl.
* Thumbnails
* History support
* Download support
* Format selection (and default formats)
* Queue multiple tracks (using fzf multiselection)

Initially this used to be a single line script. But for portability and extensibility I am breaking my vow. If you still are here for the memes then use the line below. 

```sh
#!/bin/sh
[ -z "$*" ] || curl "https://www.youtube.com/results" -s -G --data-urlencode "search_query=$*" |  pup 'script' | grep  "^ *var ytInitialData" | sed 's/^[^=]*=//g;s/;$//' | jq '..|.videoRenderer?' | sed '/^null$/d' | jq '.title.runs[0].text,.longBylineText.runs[0].text,.shortViewCountText.simpleText,.lengthText.simpleText,.publishedTimeText.simpleText,.videoId'| sed 's/^"//;s/"$//;s/\\"//g' | sed -E -n "s/(.{60}).*/\1/;N;s/\n(.{30}).*/\n\1/;N;N;N;N;s/\n/\t|/g;p" | column -t  -s "$(printf "\t")" | fzf --delimiter='\|' --nth=1,2  | sed -E 's_.*\|([^|]*)$_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\1_' | xargs -r -I'{}' mpv {}
```

# Update log

- Now ytfzf can queue videos using fzf multiselect option. Press tab to select a video. All the videos will be lined up in mpv. Use `>` and `<` to traverse them.
- Make continuous queries with `-s`
- Thumbnails! Using Ueberzug. Inspired by [fontpreview-ueberzug](https://github.com/OliverLew/fontpreview-ueberzug).
- added MacOS support
- Stdin can be taken by using `ytfzf -`, for both fzf and external menu.

# Usage

![Gif](ytfzf.gif)

```
Basic Usage: ytfzf [OPTIONS] <search-query>
  OPTIONS:
     -h, --help                           Show this help text
     -t, --thumbnails                     Show thumbnails (requires ueberzug)
                                          Doesn't work with -H -D
     -D, --ext-menu                       Use external menu(default dmenu) instead of fzf 
     -H, --choose-from-history            Choose from history 
     -x, --clear-history                  Delete history
     -m, --audio-only   <search-query>    Audio only (for music)
     -d, --download     <search-query>    Download to current directory
     -f                 <search-query>    Show available formats before proceeding
     -a, --auto-play    <search-query>    Auto play the first result, no selector
     -r  --random-play  <search-query>    Auto play a random result, no selector
     -n, --video-count= <video-count>     To specify number of videos to select with -a or -r
     -l, --loop         <search-query>    Loop: prompt selector again after video ends
     -s                 <search-query>    After the video ends make another search 
     -L, --link-only    <search-query>    Prints the selected URL only, helpful for scripting
  Use - instead of <search-query> for stdin
```

* To use dmenu with a custom width

```sh
YTFZF_EXTMENU_LEN=250 ytfzf -D
```

* Videos can be selected using fzf, dmenu or rofi.

## Examples
> Watch to find videos (with out thumbnails)

	ytfzf <query>

> Watch to find videos with thumbnails

	ytfzf -t <query>
	
* You can use multiple options together, here are some examples

> Steam audio (music), and prompt as the music finishes

	ytfzf -ml <query>


> Download a video from your history

	ytfzf -dH

> Open using dmenu in a certain format

	ytfzf -fD  

If you started watching a video and you wish to change format then 
first hit Q to save position and quit mpv, then choose your format using

	ytfzf -faH


## Useful mpv key bindings
* Use `f` for full screen
* Use `J` for subtitles (also works with audio, if the music video has subtitles)
* Use `L` for single-loop

# Dependencies
* mpv
* [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (Optional) - for menu
* [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) - to parse json
* [ueberzug](https://github.com/seebye/ueberzug) (Optional) - for thumbnails

> Fzf is optional, you can use external menu (like dmenu) with the `-D` option (no thumbnail support).
> Thumbnails only work with fzf and Ueberzug as of now.

### Arch based

# Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pystardust/ytfzf
cd ytfzf
```

Install with the Makefile
	
```sh
sudo make install
```

Uninstall with the Makefile

```sh
sudo make uninstall
```

Arch users can install ytfzf from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ytfzf-git/)
	
	yay -S ytfzf-git
        

# Defaults

Defaults can be set in the configuration file `~/.config/ytfzf/conf.sh` or with environment variables.

* Defaults can be set in `~/.config/ytfzf/conf.sh`
```sh
YTFZF_HIST=0
YTFZF_LOOP=1
YTFZF_PREF="bestvideo[height<=?1080]+bestaudio/best"
```

* Or export them in your shell config
```sh
export YTFZF_HIST=0
export YTFZF_LOOP=1
export YTFZF_PREF="bestvideo[height<=?1080]+bestaudio/best"
```

For one time settings you can specify the variables as shown

```sh
YTFZF_HIST=0 YTFZF_PREF="bestvideo[height<=?1080]+bestaudio/best" ytfzf  <query>
```
> The setting in the config will always override environment variables. This command wouldn't function as expected if `YTFZF_HIST=1` was mentioned in the config file.

> This will not include this video in your history and display it in a resolution no more than 1080p.

## Format

If you prefer to watch Youtube videos in certain option with out the prompting every single time.

```sh
YTFZF_PREF="22"                   
```
[Documentation for ytdl formats](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#format-selection)

If the preferred format is not available then, it will go back to auto selection.


## History

On by default. If you don't want history.

```sh
YTFZF_HIST=0
```
> 0: history off, 1: history on

* This history will be stored in the cache directory as `ytfzf_hst`

You can modify the file location by changing the cache directory

```sh
YTFZF_CACHE=~/.cache/ytfzf
```


## Loop menu prompt

Off by default.  Can be turned on using option `-l`. Or setting

```sh
YTFZF_LOOP=1
```

This would return you to the video selection prompt after the video is exited/ends.

> To quit the script you can press `ESC` or `^C` in the video selection prompt.

## External menu command (dmenu / rofi)

To use an external menu you will need to pass in the `-D` option
```sh
ytfzf -D
```

By default the external menu is set to dmenu `dmenu -i -l 30`. You can modify to this to rofy by

```sh
YTFZF_EXTMENU=' rofi -dmenu -fuzzy -width 1500'
```
> I don't use rofi much, I would love to hear from any rofi user on better defaults.

You also may need to modify the width of the output that is being piped into external menu.
 Depending on you screen resolution and font size this may need to be modified.
```sh
YTFZF_EXTMENU_LEN=180
```
or
```sh
YTFZF_EXTMENU_LEN=180 ytfzf -D
```

> WARNING : dmenu doesn't behave well with some fonts. Expect it to be slow with fonts you don't have.



## Currently Playing

On by default. Stores the details of the currently playing track. Empty when nothing is playing. This could be used in status bar modules.
To disable it
```sh
YTFZF_CUR=0
```

It will be stored in the ytfzf cache directory as `ytfzf_cur`


## Custom Player
By default, ytfzf uses `mpv`. custom player should have the ability to launch youtube links.

``` sh
# example: using devour
FZF_PLAYER="devour mpv"
YTFZF_PLAYER_FORMAT="devour mpv --ytdl-format="
```

# Todo

* [ ] Playlists
* [ ] Comments
* [x] Icons

## Bugs

* dwm with swallow patch: Images don't render when looped (ie, option -l)
